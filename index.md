# **About me**
-----
My name is Juraj Fulir and I'm a doctoral student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). I work in the field of Computer Graphics (CG), currently looking into the problems of differentiable rendering and incorporating those techniques for various applications in CG.

I love singing in the [Academic male choir of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://akmuz.fer.hr/akmuz/home) (in short: AKMUZ FER). I'm a Tenor 1st and I think I'm real darn good, tho colleagues next to me might dissagree.

I also lead a small journal club at the [Research Center of Youth (ICM)](http://icm.hr/) called JournalClub@FER where a couple of very enthusiastic students and colleagues from the industry come together to discuss scientific articles (usually from conferences) from various fields, with a strong preference for Machine Learning. If you are a student starting out, I definitely recommed you to join or start a club like this. It can be a lot of fun, you can learn a lot from your colleagues and significantly widen your exploration horizon.

You can find me at [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/lirfu), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Juraj55605792) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVc01LoLdOgajfAZqAWU_w), or contact me at [jurajfulir@gmail.com](mailto:jurajfulir@gmail.com). You can check out some of my older projects on my [older website](https://lirfu.herokuapp.com/).
