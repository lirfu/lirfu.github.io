# **About me**
-----
My name is Juraj Fulir and I am a doctoral student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). I work in the field of Computer Graphics (CG), currently looking into the problem of reverse rendering and incorporation of deep learning techniques in various applications in CG.

I love singing in the [Academic male choir of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://akmuz.fer.hr/akmuz/home) (in short: AKMUZ FER). I'm a Tenor 1st and I think I'm real darn good, tho colleagues next to me might dissagree.

I also lead a small journal club at the [Research Center of Youth (ICM)](http://icm.hr/) called JournalClub@FER where a couple of very enthusiastic students and colleagues from the industry come together to discuss scientific articles (usually from conferences) from various fields, with a strong theme on Machine Learning.
